As the cofounder with multiple startups behind me I am always looking at few things:

- idea I am interested in;

- team I am interested in;

- what was done;

- where you are;

- what you are looking for;

- how you are going to get there;

- your competition;

- why you are different;

- AND OF COURSE YOUR ELEVATOR SPEECH. Always start with it. This is the most important part of any presentation, this is when I decide if I want to hear more.
